<h2>Basecamp Config</h2>

	The Issue Tracker Plugin needs a configuration file setup for each project on Basecamp. This consists of the Project and Post IDs needed to post the messages from the app using the Basecamp Classic API. When the Issue Tracker Plugin has been installed in an application then the Load Script must be edited to point to the correct Basecamp-config file. If you cannot find the correct project configuration file then please speak to Dylan.
